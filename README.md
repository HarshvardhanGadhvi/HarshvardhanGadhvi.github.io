## FAQ
**Q: Why is Markdown better than writing raw HTML?**  
A: Markdown is simpler and more readable, making it easier to write and maintain.

**Q: I changed the Markdown version of my resume, so why donâ€™t I see the changes when I refresh the website in my browser?**  
A: Ensure you have committed and pushed your changes to the GitHub repository, and that GitHub Pages has had time to rebuild the site.
